				  <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
				  <p>there is a strong positive correlation between health coverage and
					 the percentage of households in poverty by state </p>
		
				  <p>which is further tested by compparing the same health coverage
					  percentage versus median household income, with a large negative 
					  correlation</p>
		
				  <p>another observation even more disturbing, is that as percentage of 
					  people with obesity by state increase, there is also a increase in 
					  the lack of health coverage, so states with lower average income, and 
					  high percentage of people in poverty, will tend to have higher levels
					  of people in obesity with a higher percentage of lacking of healthcare services.</p>
